# TextFileConvert
This provides text file conversion capabilities like the common Unix utilities "ux2dos" and "dos2ux".

I needed the capability to perform Unix text file conversions, round trip, within a VB.NET project without being dependant upon external binaries.
I couldn't find anything like that on NuGet so I wrote my own. 

Included are two console apps that show the usage.
