# TextFileConvert
This provides text file conversion capabilities like the common Unix utilities "ux2dos" and "dos2ux".

I needed the capability to perform Unix text file conversions, round trip, within a .NET project without being dependant upon external binaries.
I couldn't find anything like that on NuGet so I wrote my own.
